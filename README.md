# Skull-Stripping-Algorithm
This algorithm is used to separate the skull from the brain region
in MRI of brains which are then used by medical professionals to
analyse the brain. Various Image Processing techniques are
used through OpenCV like thresholding, opening and closing
morphology to separate the brain from non brain regions.
